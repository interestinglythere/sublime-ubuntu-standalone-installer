sublime-ubuntu-standalone-installer
===================================

Install Sublime Text 3 on any Ubuntu machine, sans root, effortlessly. This script was created for use on the Ubuntu lab computers at UC Berkeley, but should work with any Ubuntu installation.

**Note:** The Bash script, `install_sublime.sh`, is outdated. `install_sublime.py` is the current install script.
